# RAILS setup

This is a small project to make it easier to setup new rails projects.

This far it only works on my computer due to hard coded paths.

### Usage

```bash
bash setup.bash AppName InstallDir 
```

Will setup a new rails app with users that is ready to launch on heroku

InstallDir will default to you current directory.
